# Why this rule

Run `agentcfg why "$ARGUMENTS"` and report what it says.

The rules here are composed from fragments in a central release, so a
rule is not a file in this repository that can simply be edited. This
names the fragment that owns it, which is where a change has to be made,
and every repository selecting that fragment gets the change too.
